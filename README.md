Medical Cost Predictor
Overview
The Medical Cost Predictor is a machine learning-based project that estimates medical insurance costs using key health and demographic factors. It leverages a hybrid approach, combining Random Forest and XGBoost for optimal performance.

Features
Blended Model (80% Random Forest, 20% XGBoost) for accuracy
Preprocessing & Feature Engineering (scaling, encoding categorical variables)
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
Cross-validation for better generalization
Feature Importance Analysis

✅ Best Blend Ratio → 0.8 RF / 0.2 XGB ✅ Optimized performance with balanced stability and efficiency

Future Enhancements
Improve feature selection
Experiment with LightGBM or CatBoost
Optimize blend ratios further
