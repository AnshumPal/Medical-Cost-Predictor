Problem Definition and Objective :
The objective of this project is to develop a Medical Cost Prediction System using a machine learning approach. The primary goal is to predict medical insurance charges based on factors like age, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and gender. The problem is highly relevant in the medical insurance industry, as it can assist in predicting medical costs and optimizing insurance premiums for individuals based on their health data. This will help in designing a more efficient pricing model for medical insurance.
The problem statement is clear and focused on utilizing machine learning to solve real-world issues related to healthcare and insurance.



Implementation and Technical Execution : 
The project was implemented using Python and machine learning tools like Random Forest Regression for predicting medical costs. The Pandas library was used for data manipulation, while Scikit-learn provided the necessary machine learning functions. The data was preprocessed, which included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets. Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV to enhance the model's performance. The Random Forest Regressor was chosen as the model due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships and its robustness against overfitting.
The technical execution is original, as it integrates a number of key steps:

1.Data exploration
2.Preprocessing and feature selection
3.Model training and tuning
4.Evaluation using appropriate metrics (such as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error)


Results and Analysis : 
The model produced promising results in predicting medical insurance charges with a high degree of accuracy. The Random Forest Regressor demonstrated good performance after hyperparameter tuning, as seen in the low error values (e.g., Mean Absolute Error and RÂ² score).
The results were analyzed by visualizing the data using plots such as correlation heatmaps, histograms, and scatter plots, which provided deep insights into the relationships between features. A confusion matrix and feature importance plot were also included to evaluate the model's performance further and identify the most important predictors in the medical cost prediction process.
The analysis offers actionable insights into how each feature influences medical costs. For instance, the analysis showed that BMI and smoking status were significant predictors of medical expenses.
